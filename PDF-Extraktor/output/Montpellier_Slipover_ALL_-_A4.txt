GAUGE
Take time to save time! Spend 10 minutes making your sample before you
begin your project, to prevent having to adjust your pattern after you’ve
already begun, which can take hours or days to change, especially if you
have to start over completely.
The tension sample is the tension recommended for your project. It is very
important to make a tension sample in a 10x10 cm (4”x4”) area, where you
can count the number of rows and stitches that fit in order to ensure that
your tension is correct for the project. With this method, your measurements
will correspond with the specifications in the schematic. The kit includes
enough yarn to make the tension sample and the whole project.
If your sample is smaller than recommended, try to knit more loosely. If
your sample is larger than recommended, try to knit more tightly.
Ultimately, knitting is an art, not a science and you aren’t a machine; so it’s
normal to have a small variation of 1-3 cm at the end.
You can find more information about creating a stitch sample in our blog
post “HOW TO MEASURE A TENSION SAMPLE” that you will find on
our web site weareknitters.com

ÉCHANTILLON DE TENSION
Prenez votre temps pour en gagner par la suite ! Cela vous prend
seulement 10 minutes de réaliser votre échantillon alors qu’ajuster votre
pièce peut vous prendre des heures ou plusieurs jours, notamment si
vous devez tout recommencer de zéro.
L’échantillon de tension vous donne des indications sur la tension
recommandée pour mener à bien votre projet. Il est particulièrement
important de faire un échantillon de 10x10 cm, où vous pouvez compter
le nombre de rangs et de mailles pour s’assurer que la tension est la
bonne. Avec cette méthode, vos mesures corresponderont à celles
indiquées dans le patron. Le kit contient suffisamment de fibre pour
réaliser l’échantillon de tension et confectionner tout le projet.
Si l’échantillon est plus petit que recommandé, essayez de tricotez un
peu moins tendu. Si votre échantillon est plus large, tricotez plus tendu.
Pour finir, le tricot c’est un art à part entière, pas une science exacte, il
est donc normal qu’il ait une différence de 1 à 3 cm à la fin.

MASCHENPROBE
Nimm dir Zeit, um Zeit zu sparen! Du brauchst 10 Minuten um deine
Maschenprobe zu fertigen, während es Stunden oder Tage dauern
kann, wenn du die Anleitung später anpassen und eventuell von
vorne anfangen musst.
Mit der Maschenprobe wirst du überprüfen, ob die Spannung beim
Stricken die Empfohlene für dieses Projekt ist. Es ist sehr wichtig
eine Maschenprobe von 10x10 cm zu machen, bei der du die
Reihen und Maschen, die in die Probe passen, zählen kannst, um
so festzustellen, ob die Spannung richtig ist. Mit dieser Methode
werden deine Endmaße mit denen in der Anleitung übereinstimmen.
Das Set enthält ausreichend Garn um die Maschenprobe und das
komplette Projekt anzufertigen.
Wenn deine Probe kleiner als Empfohlen geworden ist, versuche
lockerer zu stricken. Wenn sie größer ausgefallen ist, versuche fester
zu stricken.
Stricken ist eine Kunst, keine Wissenschaft und du bist keine Maschine,
es ist also normal, wenn dein Strickstück am Ende 1-3 cm abweicht.
Du wirst mehr Information hierzu im Blog Post „WIE MAN DIE
SPANNUNG EINES MUSTERS MISST” finden. Diesen findest du
auf unserer Webseite weareknitters.de

MUESTRA DE TENSIÓN
¡Tómate tu tiempo para ahorrar tiempo! Hacer tu muestra te llevará
10 minutos, mientras que ajustar tu proyecto una vez tejido, te
llevará horas o incluso días si tienes que empezar de nuevo.
La muestra de tensión es la tensión recomendada para la realización
de tu proyecto. Es muy importante que antes de empezar tu labor
hagas una muestra para contar cuántos puntos y cuántas vueltas
caben en 10x10 cm para asegurarte de que tu tensión es la correcta
para este proyecto. De este modo, tus medidas corresponderán con
las especificadas en el esquema. El kit incluye suficiente lana para
realizar la muestra de tensión y tejer todo el proyecto.
Si tu muestra es más pequeña que la recomendada, trata de tejer un
poco más suelto. Si tu muestra es más grande que la recomendada,
trata de tejer un poco más apretado.
Por último, ten en cuenta que tejer no es una ciencia exacta ni se
hace a máquina. Es normal que las medidas de tu prenda finalizada
puedan variar en 1 a 3 centímetros de las que ves en este patrón.
Puedes encontrar más información sobre la muestra del punto en el

TENSIONE
Per risparmiare tempo, dedica un po’ di tempo al campione! In
10 minuti puoi realizzare un campione, grazie al quale non dovrai
apportare modifiche al capo dopo aver iniziato, le modifiche possono
richiedere ore o giornate intere, soprattutto se sei già avanti nella
lavorazione.
Fai un campione per riuscire ad arrivare alla tensione indicata per
lavorare il capo. È molto importante fare un quadrato di 10x10 cm,
poi contare il numero di maglie e ferri per assicurarti di raggiungere
la tensione corretta per il progetto. In questo modo, otterrai le misure
corrispondenti a quelle dello schema. Il kit include abbastanza filato
per realizzare sia il campione di tensione che tutto il progetto.
Se il campione è più piccolo rispetto alla dimensione consigliata,
cerca di lavorare più morbidamente. Se il campione è più grande,
cerca di lavorare un po’ più stretto.
Ricorda che il lavoro a maglia è un’arte, non una scienza esatta e tu
non sei una macchina, quindi è normale avere una variazione di 1-3
cm nel lavoro finito.
Puoi trovare ulteriori informazioni sulla mostra del campione nel
blog del nostro sito weareknitters.it, consultando l’articolo “COME
MISURARE UN CAMPIONE DI TENSIONE”.
REALIZZA IL CAMPIONE A:
MAGLIA RASATA* 10 X 10 cm
IL KIT COMPRENDE:
- 7 [7, 8, 8] gomitoli di Baby Alpaca da 50 grammi di We Are Knitters. ColoreA
- 2 [2, 2, 2] gomitoli di Touch Me Mohair da 50 grammi di We Are Knitters. Colore B
- Ferri circolari calibro 5 mm / 8 US / 6 UK.
- Un ago da lana per finire e cucire i pezzi.
- L’etichetta We Are Knitters da applicare al capo finito.
