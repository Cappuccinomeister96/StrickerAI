BEFORE YOU BEGIN
Remember to work a gauge swatch to ensure that you achieve gauge using the suggested needles. If
your gauge differs, this will result in the wrong proportions of your cardigan.
Sizeguide
Levitate Wrap has an oversize fit. The smaller sizes have a greater positive ease than the larger
sizes in order to complement the individual body the best. Calculate a positive ease of approx. 30-
35 cm [11.75-13.75 inches] in size XS-XL and approx. 20 cm [8 inches] in size 2XL-4XL.
The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) are equivalent to the European standard sizes 34 (36) 38
(40) 42 (44) 46 (48) and suit a bust circumference of approx. 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-
110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) cm [31.5-33.5 (33.5-35.5) 35.5-37.5 (37.5-39.5) 39.5-43.25
(43.25-47.25) 47.25-51.25 (51.25-55) inches].
For example: You measure 89 cm [35 inches] at your bust + 30-35 cm [11.75-13.75 inches] = 119-
124 cm [46.75 - 48.75 inches]. Meaning you would choose a size S with a circumference of 123 cm
[48.5 inches].
Introduction to the work flow
The cardigan is worked from the top down.
First, work the top part of the back section. The back is shaped by increasing, which slopes the
shoulders to provide the right fit. Then, pick up and knit stitches along the shoulders and work the
two front sections separately.
Proceed to join the front and back sections to knit in one piece and work the body back and forth
using circular needles whilst increasing along the front edges to create the wrap effect. The body is
finished with a double knitted edge, which also creates the one ribbon for tying.
The sleeves are worked from picked up stitches around the armhole, shaped by decreasing and
finished with a folded edge, that is attached by knitting.
At the front, work a double knitted knitted front edge, which also creates the other ribbon for tying.
Increases
The increases are worked to lean either towards the right (M1R / M1Rp) or left (M1L / M1Lp).
M1R: With your left needle, pick up the bar (between the sts on the right and left needles) from
back to front and knit.
M1Rp: With your left needle, pick up the bar from back to front and purl.
M1L: With your left needle, pick up the bar from front to back and knit through the back loop.
M1Lp: With your left needle, pick up the bar from front to back and purl through the back loop.
Have a look here for how to work the purl increases:

Decreases
The decreases are worked to lean either towards the right (k2tog) or left (k2tog tbl).
k2tog: Knit 2 sts together.
k2tog tbl: 2 sts knitted together through the back loop, using the ‘SSK improved’ method.
Slip 1 knitwise, slip 1 purlwise, knit the two stitches together through the back loop.

FRONT EDGE AND RIBBON
The front edge / ribbons are worked in double knitting back and forth using 5 mm [US 8] circular
needles.
It is important to match the given gauge, as your edges otherwise will pull or become too loose.
Therefore, remember to work a gauge swatch in double knitting before proceeding with this
section.
TIP! Search for ’double knitted edges’ on YouTube if you need further help with the following section.
Front edge
Begin picking up stitches at the bottom of the right front.
Pick up and knit 1 st for every stitch all the way around your edge using 5 mm [US 8] circular
needles. In the following section, this is referred to as the pick up edge.
TIP! Make sure to pick up and knit stitches tightly. This creates the neatest possible transition between
the edge and fronts.
Break the yarn.
Join in a new strand of yarn and cast on 11 sts using the provisional cast on method - or another
temporary cast on - on the side of your circular needle that is closest to the right-hand side of the
cardigan (right when wearing the cardigan).
NOTE! It is important to cast on with ’live stitches’ to be picked up later, when working the bottom
edge.
Now begin your double knitting. It can be helpful to use a double pointed needle to ease the
workflow.
Work back and forth across the 11 newly cast on stitches at all times. On every RS row, include 1 st
from the pick up edge into your work. In this way, the double knitted edge will follow the cardigan
edge all the way around.
Work as follows:
1st row (RS row): *K1, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front* repeat from * - * to 1 st remaining,
k2tog tbl (the last of the newly cast on stitches and 1 st from the pick up edge).
2nd row (WS row): *slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front, k1* repeat from * - * to 1 st
remaining, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front.
Repeat 1st and 2nd row until you have worked your way around the front edge.
Finish with a WS row.
Now prepare the bottom edge of the cardigan for the ribbon. Do this by reducing the number of
stitches in both ends of the front bands from 11 to 6.
Begin by transferring the 11 sts on hold from the provisional cast on onto the 6 mm [US 10] circular
needles that hold the cardigan stitches (ie. the stitches that form the bottom edge).
Then, continue working where you left off - ie. the bottom edge of the front- using 5 mm [US 8]
circular needles:
K2tog tbl a total of 6 times (The last repeat knits 1 st from the front edge together with the former
edge stitch), k to 12 sts remaining, k2tog a total of 6 times across the remaining stitches.
All stitches are now joined on 5 mm [US 8] circular needles.
Break the yarn.
Bottom edge of the cardigan.
Now work the bottom edge of the cardigan. Continue working in double knitting.
6
Join in a new strand of yarn and cast on 11 sts using the Italian/tubular cast on method and the 5
mm [US 6] circular needles, that hold the bottom edge stitches, at the left-hand side of the cardigan
(left when wearing the cardigan).
TIP! The first loop of your cast on is considered a purl st, meaning that the first ‘real’ stitch in your cast
on, should be a knit st.
Now begin your double knitting. It can be helpful to use a double pointed needle to ease the work
flow.
Work back and forth across the 11 newly cast on stitches at all times. On every RS row, include 1 st
from the bottom edge into your work. In this way, the double knitted band will follow the edge all
the way around.
Work as follows:
1st row (RS row): *K1, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front* repeat from * - * to 1 st remaining,
k2tog tbl (the last of the newly cast on stitches and 1 st from the bottom edge).
2nd row (WS row): *slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front, k1* repeat from * - * to 1 st
remaining, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front.
Repeat 1st and 2nd row until you have worked your way around the bottom edge of the cardigan.
Right ribbon
Now work the right ribbon. Continue working back and forth across the same 11 stitches.
Continue as follows:
1st row (RS row): *K1, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front* repeat from * - * to 1 st remaining,
k1.*
2nd row (WS row): *slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front, k1* repeat from * - * to 1 st
remaining, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front.
Repeat 1st and 2nd row until you have a ribbon measuring 32 cm [12.5 inches] or desired length.
Change to 4 mm [US 6] needles and work 1st – 2nd row another 2 times. Bind off using the
Italian/tubular bind off method.
Left ribbon
Now work the left ribbon. This part will need attached to the right-hand side of the cardigan in the
end.
Cast on 11 sts using the Italian/tubular cast on method and 4 mm [US 6] needles.
Work as follows:
1st row (RS row): *K1, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front* repeat from * - * to 1 st remaining,
k1.*
2nd row (WS row): *slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front, k1* repeat from * - * to 1 st
remaining, slip 1 st purlwise with the yarn in front.
Work 1st – 2nd row a total of 2 times.
Change to 5 mm [US 8] needles.
Continue working in double knitting until the ribbon measures 34 cm [13.25 inches] - ie. 2 cm [0.75
inches] longer than the other ribbon for tying.
Now attach the ribbon to the cardigan by grafting it on. Transfer the purl sts to a helping needle and
begin attaching the ribbon at the left-hand side of the bottom edge at M1 - ie. at your left side seam -
on the RS of the cardigan.
7
First, graft on the knit sts using Kitchener/duplicate stitch and then graft on the purl stitches on
hold, again using Kitchener/duplicate stitch.
TIP! The technique used for sewing together is the same as you would use to sew together an i-cord
edge. Have a look here for how to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGpr03uSw3w&t=72s
SLEEVES
Now work the sleeves. Pick up and knit the sleeve stitches around the armhole using 6 mm [US 10]
circular needles. You can either use 40 cm [16 inches] circular needles or 80 cm [US 32] circular
needles in combination with the magic loop technique.
Pick up and knit 58 (60) 62 (64) 66 (68) 70 (72) sts around the armhole. The pick up frequency is
equivalent to approx. 2 out of 3 sts (ie.: pick up and knit in 2 sts, skip 1 st and repeat).
Join to work in the round. Place a marker in the middle underneath the armhole to mark the
beginning of round.
TIP! If you have picked up too many stitches, reduce to the correct number of stitches by knitting 2
together repeatedly on the first rnd.
Work stocking stitch in the round and at the same time decrease as follows.
First, work your decreases on every 13th rnd, then every 7th rnd. For every rnd of decrease, you
decrease by 2 sts.
Work as follows:
1st – 12th rnd: K all sts.
13th rnd: K1, k2tog, k to 3 remaining, k2tog tbl, k1.
Work 1st – 13th rnd a total of 3 (3) 3 (3) 3 (3) 2 (2) times.
Now decrease every 7th rnd.
TIP! Would you like a shorter sleeve than the final 45 (45) 45 (45) 45 (45) 46 (46) cm [17.75 (17.75)
17.75 (17.75) 17.75 (17.75) 18 (18) inches]? Then decrease every 6th rnd instead of every 7th rnd.
This will make the sleeve approx. 3 cm [1.25 inches] shorter.
Work as follows:
1st – 6th rnd: K all sts.
7th rnd: K1, k2tog, k to 3 sts remaining, k2tog tbl, k1.
Work 1st – 7th rnd a total of 7 (7) 7 (7) 7 (7) 9 (9) times.
You now have 38 (40) 42 (44) 46 (48) 48 (48) sts on your needles.
Your sleeve now measures approx. 41 (41) 41 (41) 41 (41) 42 (42) cm [16 (16) 16 (16) 16 (16)
16.5 (16.5) inches], when measured along the inside seam.
Before you proceed, make sure that the sleeve length suits you. The bottom edge will add another 4
cm [1.5 inches] to the length. If you would like a longer sleeve, continue working stocking stitch in
the round until desired length.
Change to 4 mm [US 6] needles.
Work 11 rnds of stocking stitch.
Purl 1 rnd (NOTE! Make sure to tighten your stitches when working this row - this is your folding
edge, so it is important that the stitches are not loose).
Work 10 rnds of stocking stitch.
Now fold the edge inwards and knit attached. It can be helpful to turn your garment inside out. This
will ease the workflow.
8
Knit 1 st from the 1st rnd knitted with the 4 mm [US 6] needles together with 1 st from your
needles and bind off the stitch. Continue repeating to the end of round until you have completed the
bind off for all stitches.
Your sleeve now measures 45 (45) 45 (45) 45 (45) 46 (46) cm [17.75 (17.75) 17.75 (17.75) 17.75
(17.75) 18 (18) inches] along the inside seam.
Work the opposite sleeve in the same way.
FINISHING
Now weave in all loose ends. Place and attach the two snap fasteners onto each front at the bottom
band itself. In this way, the ‘edges’ of the cardigan are kept in place when used.
It is recommended to wash and block your cardigan before use for an even neater result.
